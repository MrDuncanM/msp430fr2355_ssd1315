# msp430fr2355_ssd1315
SSD1315 Demos using the MSP430FR2553.



#### What the Heck?
I'll keep this short until I have time for a write-up...
- This is intended for Code Composer Studio.
- This is experimental code!
- If you create a venv for the python script in the ssd1315 submodule, DO NOT enable MCD whatever in CCS. It will break the project and I don't care why.

Otherwise, have fun!
